# Homework 01

Herein lies the contents for the first homework assignment. Much of this assignment can be done on pen and paper and then scanned back to PDF and uploaded to this repository. Alternatively, if you'd rather type out your answers in something like Markdown and just upload that file, that is also entirely fine. If you type up answers in some other form, please export them to PDF before uploading.

The main file that you'll need that is already in the repo is the `metal_bands.sql` file, which contains the commands to generate and populate a table in your database. You can either open the file in VSCode and then run both commands (making sure that your desired database is selected), or you could copy and paste the commands in and run them that way.
